# CIFAR-10 Challenge

This repository contains solutions and experiments performed for the CIFAR-10 image classification challenge using various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures.

## Overview

The goal of this project was to achieve a minimum validation accuracy of 80% on the CIFAR-10 dataset within 20 training epochs. Multiple models were developed and fine-tuned using techniques like hyperparameter tuning, transfer learning, and regularization.

## Contents

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook files containing the code for all experiments.
- `models/`: Pre-trained model checkpoints saved during training.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the repository.
- `plots/`: Loss and accuracy plots for each model.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies required to run the project.

## Models

1. **Baseline Model**: A CNN with two convolutional blocks and two dense layers.
2. **Improved CNN**: Added an extra convolutional block and fine-tuned hyperparameters.
3. **Transfer Learning**:
   - VGG16
   - ResNet50
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Performed using Keras Tuner with random search strategy.
5. **Final Model**:
   - Combination of manual architecture and hyperparameter tuning with kernel regularization.

## Key Features

- **Dataset**:
  - CIFAR-10 dataset from Keras.
  - Split: 40,000 training, 10,000 validation, 10,000 testing.
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, Keras Tuner, matplotlib.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Optimized training using available GPUs.

## Results

| Model                     | Validation Accuracy | Test Accuracy | Observations                                |
|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Baseline CNN              | ~73%               | -             | Basic architecture with 10 epochs.          |
| Improved CNN              | ~74%               | -             | Added one convolutional block.              |
| VGG16 Transfer Learning   | ~32%               | -             | Limited success due to dataset constraints. |
| ResNet50 Transfer Learning| ~37%               | -             | Slight improvement, but not satisfactory.   |
| Hyperparameter Tuned CNN  | ~74%               | -             | Random search with 10 trials.               |
| Final Regularized Model   | TBD                | TBD           | Fine-tuned architecture and regularization. |
