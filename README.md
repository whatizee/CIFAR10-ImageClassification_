# CIFAR10-ImageClassification_
**CIFAR-10 Image Classification Challenge**:   This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 classes. It features custom models, transfer learning (VGG16, ResNet50), hyperparameter tuning, and regularization to achieve optimal performance, targeting 80%+ validation accuracy in 20 epochs.
